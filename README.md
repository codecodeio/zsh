## .zshrc Sharing  
Fork this repo or create your own.  

## Initialize your home folder and set the git repo
```bash
$ cd ~  
$ git init  
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:codecodeio/zsh.git 
$ git pull
``` 

The .gitignore file will only allow .zshrc, README.md, and .gitignore. You don't want anything else in your home folder in this repo.
